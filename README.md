# Socket-TCP-IP

A simple Client-Server C program that performs a TCP-IP communication using Sockets (in linux) in Localhost.

1. Clients (3 clients) send messages to the Server.
2. The server counts the occurence of a letter (defined by the user).
3. The server answers each Client with occurence of the letter on their messages.
4. Finaly, the server sends the message which contains more letter to all clients.
